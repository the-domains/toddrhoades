I don't know if I should laugh or cry as I write this article. Maybe a little of both! I have made all of these mistakes over the last 20 years, but I have learned from them as well. The landscape and culture of ministry continue to change, so I still make mistakes, but hopefully new ones. Leaders must keep learning! What makes staffing mistakes tricky is that they rarely look like mistakes when you make them. It's in hindsight that we learn. I stopped just short of begging a friend who is a senior pastor not to hire a certain person to be his associate. He was convinced that they could conquer the world together and build a great church. The person he wanted to hire was his wife. He hired her anyway and things went well for a while. She was smart, organized, and, candidly, tougher than he was. Things looked good, until about a year into the process when she began to make decisions that he didn't like. Over the next six months it got so bad he wanted to fire her. Fire his wife!? Right! He called me in as a consultant. Now I'm charging him for advice I tried to give him for free. But he needed a consultant to "speak into the issue." Honestly I was torn; she was good. I thought about firing him. It was a mess, but it actually worked out over a long period of time. We re-organized, still utilizing her leadership skills but creating some space between their responsibilities.
