Hey... I'm working on a project and could use your really quick input.

Simply hit reply to this email with your answer to three questions:

1\. When did you leave your last church job? (what year)

2\. Why did you transition?

3\. Was the transition (in your opinion) healthy?

I have a certain hypothesis I'm trying to either prove or disprove, and your answer will help me start to figure it out.

No need to be wordy. Quick answers are fine. But if you want to take a moment to tell me your story in depth... all the better!

I'll keep your answers absolutely confidential, so be as brutally honest as you need to be.

Of course, I will compile my findings and share my hypothesis and findings to you in a later email.

Thanks for all you do!

Todd
